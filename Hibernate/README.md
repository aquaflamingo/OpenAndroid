# Hibernate - Better Rest Calculator

Have you ever felt groggy, tired, or like you haven't slept after 8 hours of sleep? Rest is essential for a web balanced mental state and living.

However, in today's age we focus too heavily on the number of *hours* we sleep which is not a great indicator of sleep quality. Instead, Hibernate focuses on **cycles** of sleep.

Regular alarm clocks can wake us up in the middle of nightly sleep cycles making us groggy in the morning.

With Hibernate, you can focus on the number of full sleep cycles you complete during the night as an indicator of your rest quality, by calculating your ideal bed time based on your morning alarm.
