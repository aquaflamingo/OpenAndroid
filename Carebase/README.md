# CareBase

The patient-doctorâ€™s office interaction for patients dealing with the process of cancer treatment, remission, and relapse is very stressful. 

There are few dedicated digital mediums for communicating progress, summaries, recommendations for the treatment leading to decreased transparency of experience, and inefficiencies in managing related information.

CareBase is a new mobile application poised to overcome the barriers and anxiety felt by all parties managing the stressful process of cancer treatment.
