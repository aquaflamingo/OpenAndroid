### An place to express your ideas

Conscious allows you to capture your precious thoughts and ideas in a single place.

Speak your mind or express yourself through written thoughts.

### Thoughts are powerful things.

You can't unthink, edit or delete your thoughts in real life, Conscious is the same, there are no drafts, editing or deleting thoughts.

Currently all data, thoughts and entries are saved on your phone, currently there is no back up support.

Conscious is an experimental app, and the program is still being actively built.

Our goal is to build an space to express your intellectual ideas and thoughts.
